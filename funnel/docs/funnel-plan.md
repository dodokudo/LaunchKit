# Funnel Plan (Panel + Schedule)

Purpose: Use this template to collect all inputs in one pass, then reflect them into the panel and schedule.

Flow:
1) Ask everything in one message.
2) Summarize the answers.
3) If OK, apply changes.
4) If not OK, fix and re-apply.

Questions (answer in order):
1) Goal (what is the final outcome?)
2) Panel design
   - Entry channel(s)
   - Registration step
   - Segments (new/existing/paid/etc.)
   - Branching rules (if/then)
   - Routes per branch (what to send)
   - Final node (purchase/participation)
3) Phases (names in order)
4) Schedule
   - Display period (start/end)
   - Sales period (start/end + days)
   - Segment order (top to bottom)
   - Key deliveries per day/segment

Output format (example):
- Goal: ...
- Entry: ...
- Registration: ...
- Segments: ...
- Branching: ...
- Routes: ...
